# Security Report: Log-Based Threats, PCAP-Based Threats, and Threat Intelligence Matches

## Date: 26th Feb 2025

### 1. Introduction
This report provides an overview of security threats identified through log analysis, PCAP file examination, and threat intelligence matches. The findings are crucial for understanding potential vulnerabilities and enhancing the security posture of the organization.

### 2. Log-Based Threats
- **Description**: Log-based threats are identified through the analysis of system and application logs. These threats can indicate unauthorized access, data breaches, or malicious activities.
- **Indicators**:
  - Unusual login attempts from multiple IPs, suggesting potential brute-force attacks.
  - Access to sensitive files outside of normal hours, indicating possible insider threats or compromised accounts.
  - Repeated failed login attempts followed by a successful login, which may indicate credential stuffing attacks.

### 3. PCAP-Based Threats
- **Description**: PCAP (Packet Capture) files contain network traffic data that can be analyzed to detect malicious activities, such as malware infections or data exfiltration.
- **Findings**:
  - Malicious IPs identified through VirusTotal: [4.188.19.241, 79.134.225.79, 104.223.119.167 ]
  - No suspicious User-Agents detected.
  - Protocols used: Protocols used: ['UDP': 6, 'DNS': 6, 'TCP': 5621]

### 4. Threat Intelligence Matches
- **Description**: Threat intelligence involves the collection and analysis of information regarding existing or emerging threats. This includes indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as malicious URLs, IPs, and file hashes.
- **Sources**:
  - VirusTotal
  - Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- **Results**:
  - Multiple matches found for known malicious IPs: [4.188.19.241, 79.134.225.79, 104.223.119.167 ]
  - Confirmed presence of threats within the analyzed data, including malware signatures and phishing attempts.

### 5. Recommendations
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement more robust logging and monitoring solutions to detect anomalies in real-time, utilizing SIEM tools for better visibility.
- **Regular Threat Intelligence Updates**: Continuously update threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about new threats and adjust defenses accordingly.
- **User  Education**: Conduct training sessions for users to recognize phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics, fostering a security-aware culture.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and regularly update an incident response plan to address potential security breaches effectively.

### 6. Conclusion
The analysis of log data, PCAP files, and threat intelligence has revealed significant security threats that require immediate attention. By implementing the recommended actions, organizations can strengthen their defenses against potential attacks.
